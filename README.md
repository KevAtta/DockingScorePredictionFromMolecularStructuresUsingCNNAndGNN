# Docking Score Prediction Using CNNs and GNNs

This repository contains the source code for a university project developed as part of the Master’s Degree program in Applied Computer Science at the University of Urbino. The project was carried out for the course *Applicazioni dell’Intelligenza Artificiale* (Applications of Artificial Intelligence) and focuses on predicting docking scores using both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

The project was developed collaboratively by [Giorgia Roselli](https://github.com/GioRoss) and me.

## What It Does

- **Docking Score Prediction**: Utilizes CNNs and GNNs to evaluate and predict the docking score of molecular complexes, aiding in structure-based drug discovery and virtual screening tasks.
- **Data Preprocessing and Training**: Includes scripts for cleaning and preparing the input data, as well as training deep learning models with custom hyperparameters.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Implements various metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE, correlation scores) and techniques (e.g., cross-validation) to assess model effectiveness.

Feel free to explore the repository to learn more about the implementation details.
